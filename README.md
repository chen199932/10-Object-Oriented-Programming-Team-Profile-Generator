# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.

## Installation

To install this application, first, branch the Github Repo and clone the repo to your local machine. Then, you will need to install the node dependencies which can be done by running the npm install command in your terminal/bash shell. 
## Usage

To use this application, first, pull up the repo's folder in your terminal/bash shell and run the command node app,js. This will then prompt you with the welcome message and how to use the program. Read the messages and either select from the list what you want to submit, or submit the requested
information. You will be prompted for information such as full names, emails, employee ID numbers, github profiles, office numbers, and university/schools depending on the type of team member you are submitting. When submitting the team member roles, there will only be one team manager to submit.
Once the manager has been added, you will be prompted to add either a new engineer or a new intern. You can add as many engineers or interns as you wish. Once your team has been added in full to the application, you can select the No option for adding new team members. This will complete the
application and export the HTML file to the output folder. You can now view this HTML file or host it on your website to display your team profiles.
